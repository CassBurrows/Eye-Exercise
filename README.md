# Eye-Exercise
In the Eye Exercise, we were given starter code, which included the the styles.css file for the design of the eyes, the index.html file for the layout on the page, and the eyes.js file. We were to add a second eye to the page, that would have the same properties of the first eye, and fit on the page alongside the first eye.

You can run the code by downloading all of the files given, and putting the .html file onto your browser.
